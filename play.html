	   <br><br><p>Shuffle the cards and lay them face down in rows on the table.<br> The first player turns over 2 cards.<br>If the pictures match, the player keeps the cards and tries again for another match.
        <br> If they do not match the cards are turned over again and the player to the left takes a turn.<br> Each player must try to remember where they have seen cards,<br> so they can use them to make a match. 
        <br>When all of the cards have been matched, players count their pairs. 
         The one with the most wins <br><br> </p>
